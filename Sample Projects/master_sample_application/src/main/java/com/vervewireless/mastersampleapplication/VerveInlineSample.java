            "<p>Sunday night, Varner, 30, won the first match on criteria after posting two takedowns. But the younger Snyder wore Varner down over the final two matches, outscoring Varner 10-1 in their final two matches.</p>\n" +
            "<p>\"I watched the 2012 Olympics and I was like `Shoot. If I want to make the Olympics I have to be that guy,' \" said Snyder, then just 16. \"When you've got somebody like that in your class you have to train as hard as you possibly can.\"</p>\n" +
